class railwayForm{
    submit(){
        alert(this.name+": form submitted")
    }
    cancel(){
        alert(this.name+": form cancelled")
    }
    fill(givenName){
        this.name = givenName;
    }
}

let member1 = new railwayForm()
member1.fill("Rock")


member1.submit()
member1.cancel()

what is happening can you explain step by step 
and why we should do like this real case senario

Here, a class railwayForm is defined with three methods:

submit(): Displays an alert with the message that includes the name property and "form submitted".
cancel(): Displays an alert with the message that includes the name property and "form cancelled".
fill(givenName): Assigns the value of givenName to the name property of the instance

Creating an Instance:

javascript
Copy code
let member1 = new railwayForm()
A new instance of the railwayForm class is created and assigned to the variable member1.

Filling the Form:

javascript
Copy code
member1.fill("Rock")
The fill method is called on member1 with the argument "Rock". This sets the name property of member1 to "Rock".

Submitting the Form:

javascript
Copy code
member1.submit()
The submit method is called on member1. This triggers an alert displaying "Rock: form submitted" because the name property of member1 is "Rock".

Cancelling the Form:

javascript
Copy code
member1.cancel()
The cancel method is called on member1. This triggers an alert displaying "Rock: form cancelled" because the name property of member1 is "Rock".

Why Use This Pattern in a Real-World Scenario
Modularity and Reusability:

The railwayForm class encapsulates form-related behavior, making it reusable. You can create multiple instances of this class, each representing a different form, without repeating the code for submit, cancel, and fill methods.
Maintainability:

Centralizing form behavior in a class makes it easier to maintain and update the form logic. If the logic for submitting or canceling a form changes, you only need to update the methods in the class.
Instance-Specific Data:

Each instance of railwayForm can hold its own data (like the name property in this case). This is useful in scenarios where multiple forms need to be managed independently.
Encapsulation:

Encapsulation helps in keeping the data (properties) and behavior (methods) together, which is a core principle of object-oriented programming. This makes the code more intuitive and easier to understand.
Real-World Example
Imagine a railway booking system where multiple users are filling out booking forms simultaneously. Each form instance (e.g., member1, member2, etc.) can hold information specific to a particular user. This pattern ensures that user data is kept separate and that the operations on each form are encapsulated within their respective instances.
